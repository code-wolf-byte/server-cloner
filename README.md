# server-cloner
This project was made to allow users to clone Discord Servers. This is not within Discord's ToS and I would not reccomend using this. This was just developed as a fun project while trying to explore the self-bots section of Discord's API and finding ways to protect against it. This is a great tool for creating a server from Scratch without manually creating servers and various channels within it.

## Prerequisites
- python 3.8 or higher  `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
- pip installed and configured `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/`

## Setup
- clone or download the repository as a `ZIP`
- for people not into coding, use 'install.bat' as a 1 time intallation step
- use 'bot.bat' if you have already intalled the bot and all its prerequisites


##Risk of Use
Due to this being out of Discord's ToS, there is a possiblity leading to the termination of your Discord Account.
